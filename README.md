# SharpLibrary

This repository is a C# port of [DDD by examples - Library](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples/library).
It is a project of a library, driven by real business requirements and a good usecase to exercise domain driven design on.
The main steps of event storming on the big picture and design level as well as the identification of bounded contexts can be found there and are not repeated here.

This repository can be retraced through the following steps:
